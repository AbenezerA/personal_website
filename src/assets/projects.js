I first tried implementing it from within the navbar (implemented as an upper-level route that wraps all other routes). However, this made it very difficult to pass the search input to the main page component, where the API fetch call was being made. Thus, I decided to implement the search bar from within the main page instead of the navbar."

                  "Previously, mentors at CTP Ethiopia used to release their instructional content on Telegram and YouTube channels which were prone to getting cluttered, making it hard for mentees to find the content they were looking for. In addition, there was no consistent way of releasing homework or assignments. The webapp serves to solve these problems of irregularity and inconsistency by presenting all content to the mentee via a few clicks from the dashboard. Content is grouped by subject and by week, both of which the user can select for easily using navigation menus.",
